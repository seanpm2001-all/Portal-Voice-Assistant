# Concept

## ///Seanpm2001/Portal-voice-assistant.git

### Voices

The portal voice assistant comes with 7 different voices (8 if you count yourself, but that isn't canonical)

> Voice 1: GLaDOS

> Voice 2: Wheatley

> Voice 3: Cave Johnson

> Voice 4: Caroline

> Voice 5: Announcer

> Voice 6: Working turret

> Voice 7: Defective turret

> Voice 8: Chell (mute) can still make footstep noises (this is you, for added realism, use your keybaord, and not your voice, as it is not just a voice assistant, it can be used with keyboard and mouse as well)

### Semi-mod status

Semi-mod (might have to be a semi-mod to survive. Valve allows mods of their games, providing you purchase the source (game you are trying to mod) game first. The status of Semi-mod, is so that you have to buy Portal 1 or Portal 2 to use this, so that the project can't be C&D'd (Cease and Desist letter'd) and so I can develop it without much issue. With Valves potential approval in the future, the legacy version can be a mod, and the project can be branched off to a standalone state.

### Written in

Languages to write in: C, Python, Rust

### Starter commands

#### Wheatley

Wheatley response: Pop a portal over there

Detach from management rail

#### Chell

Turn off the lights (GLaDOS response: "what's that? Who turned off the lights")

Responses can be toggled on and off

### Hardware

Fan-made hardware will be supported. Hardware wanted:

Wheatley, with management rail

GLaDOS, with screen that flashes tons of images, as in the original Portal game

Working turret (with non-hazardous bullets by default)

Defective turret (with non-hazardous bullets by default)

(if you choose to modify the turret to shoot lethal/harmful bullets, do it at your own risk. I can't control people doing this, and I won't be able to defend you legally if you use rubber, metal, or other hazardous bullet types)

Interactive Core (the main component)

Corrupt cores (audio only)

Artificial Intelligence will not be included, especially a rogue A.I. Unless there is a way to create a safe AI, I am not doing it or supporting it.

### Proposal (unedited)

What Valve needs to make/allow others to make:
Portal voice assistant (switch between 7 different voices from the beloved Portal game series)

> Voice 1: GLaDOS
> Voice 2: Wheatley
> Voice 3: Cave Johnson
> Voice 4: Caroline
> Voice 5: Announcer
> Voice 6: Working turret
> Voice 7: Defective turret
> Voice 8: Chell (mute) can still make footstep noises

This would be a hugely popular idea, I would get one myself even, which is highly unlike me
